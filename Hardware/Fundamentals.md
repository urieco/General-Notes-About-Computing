# Electricity
Ref: [What is electricity? Electricity Explained - (1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru032Mfsfig)
- An atom contains: 
  + Neutrons (No electric charge or neutral charge, half the weight of the atom).
  + Protons (Have a positive charge, half of the weight of the atom).
  + Electrons (Have a negative charge, signficantly lighter than Neutrons and Protons).

- In a **stable, resting, or rather neutral electrical condition**, these charges balance each other out within the atom. This gives the atom a net electric charge of zero. â†’ **Lowest possible energy level (ground state)**. 
  + Protons > Electrons: Positively charged.
  + Protons < Electrons: Negatively charged. 
  + It all depends on how the atom loses or gains more electrons.

(Ref: [A Better Way To Picture Atoms](https://youtu.be/W2Xb2GFK2yc) - Orbital model as in comparison to the Bohr model (a much simpler representation of an atom, also known as the planetary model))

- Atoms of one element all have the same number of protons, but can have different numbers of neutrons and electrons (Carbon-12, the stable one vs Carbon-14) - they are called **isotopes**.
